<h1>Strategies from World War II</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">A summary of major Allied and Axis strategic doctrines used during WWII.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Allied Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Island Hopping (Pacific)</strong> – The U.S. bypassed heavily fortified Japanese islands, capturing weaker ones to advance toward Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Bombing</strong> – Massive Allied bombing campaigns targeting German and Japanese industry, infrastructure, and military production.</li>
        <li><strong>Convoy System (Atlantic)</strong> – Protecting merchant ships from U-boats by grouping them with naval escorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Operation Overlord (D-Day Strategy)</strong> – Amphibious assault and breakout from Normandy to liberate Western Europe.</li>
        <li><strong>Deception Operations (e.g., Operation Bodyguard)</strong> – Fake armies, radio traffic, and misleading intelligence to confuse Axis forces about invasion targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Lend-Lease Strategy</strong> – Supplying Allied nations (UK, USSR, China) with critical materials to sustain the war effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Combined Arms Warfare</strong> – Coordination between infantry, armor, and air support for breakthroughs (e.g., in France after 1944).</li>
        <li><strong>Encirclement & Pincer Movements (Eastern Front)</strong> – Soviet strategies like “Deep Battle” to break through and encircle German armies.</li>
        <li><strong>Unrestricted Submarine Warfare (against Japan)</strong> – U.S. submarines targeted Japanese merchant shipping to cripple supply lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Blockades & Economic Pressure</strong> – Cutting off Axis access to oil, resources, and shipping lanes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Axis (Nazi Germany) Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blitzkrieg (“Lightning War”)</strong> – Fast, coordinated attacks using tanks, aircraft, and mechanized infantry to overwhelm opponents quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>U-Boat Wolfpacks</strong> – Groups of German submarines attacking Allied convoys in the Atlantic.</li>
        <li><strong>Lebensraum Strategy</strong> – Expansion eastward into Poland and the Soviet Union to seize land and resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Scorched Earth (Retreat Strategy)</strong> – Destroying infrastructure while retreating to slow Allied advances.</li>
        <li><strong>Fortress Europe</strong> – Heavy fortification of coasts and key defense lines (e.g., the Atlantic Wall).</li>
        <li><strong>V-Weapons Campaign</strong> – Use of V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks to terrorize and demoralize the UK population.</li>
        <li><strong>Operation Barbarossa Strategy</strong> – A massive, multi-pronged invasion of the USSR, aiming for rapid collapse via encirclement.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer Diplomacy</strong> – Forming quick treaties and then breaking them to maintain initiative (e.g., Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact).</li>
        <li><strong>Total War Mobilization</strong> – Exploiting conquered territories for labor and resources to fuel the war machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive Elastic Withdrawal</strong> – Later-war German strategy to trade space for delaying Allied forces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        World War II featured some of the most influential strategies in military history. 
        The Allies relied heavily on economic strength, industrial output, and coordinated multi-front operations, 
        while Nazi Germany emphasized rapid offensives, mechanized warfare, and strategic submarines.
