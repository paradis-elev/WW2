                By 1944, Jewish communities in Europe were living under extreme persecution.  
                The Nazi regime had stripped Jewish people of their rights, homes, property, 
                and often their ability to work. Daily life was marked by fear, scarcity, 
                and the constant presence of discriminatory laws. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jewish families in ghettos faced overcrowding, limited access to food, 
                and surveillance by occupying forces. Education was banned or heavily restricted. 
                Faith and cultural traditions were maintained in secret as acts of resistance 
                and preservation of identity.

        <h2>Forced Labor and Enslavement</h2>

            <p>
                During this time, millions of Jewish people were forced into labor camps. 
                Though different from historical slavery in other eras, the Nazi system functioned 
                as a brutal form of enslavement: people were imprisoned, worked under inhumane 
                conditions, given minimal food, and subjected to violence and cruelty.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Many were assigned to factories, mines, railroads, and construction sites. 
                Survival depended on physical strength, luck, and occasional acts of solidarity 
                among prisoners. Despite the horrors, individuals tried to maintain dignity 
                through mutual support, sharing food, or preserving religious practices in secret.

        <h2>Hope and Resistance</h2>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Jewish+Resistance+1944" alt="Placeholder Jewish resistance 1944">

                Even in the darkest conditions, Jewish resistance movements continued to operate. 
                Some resistance was armed—such as uprisings in ghettos and sabotage in forced labor camps.
                Other resistance was cultural and spiritual: keeping traditions, teaching children in secret,
                documenting atrocities, or maintaining hope for freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1944, as Allied forces advanced, many imprisoned people held on to the belief 
                that liberation was approaching. Diaries, letters, and testimonies from this year 
                reveal a powerful mixture of suffering, courage, and the will to survive.
