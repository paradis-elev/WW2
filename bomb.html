    <h1>Bombs and Their Global Impact (1940–2025)</h1>
    <p>A Historical, Political, and Technological Overview</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        From World War II through the 21st century, bombs have played a major role 
        in global conflicts, military strategy, international policy, and humanitarian 
        concerns. This project examines significant developments in bomb technology, 
        major historical events involving bombs, and the worldwide political and ethical 
        implications of their use.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        From 1940 to 2025, bomb technology has evolved dramatically—but so has the world's 
        awareness of the catastrophic consequences of their use. Understanding this history 
        helps inform debates about peace, diplomacy, and the future of global security.
